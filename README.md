# PythonBot
### What is this about
The purpose of this project is to try out the setup and capabilities of chatbots on the Symphony platform.  

### How to run
First you will need to add 'rsa' folder in the root directory. Link to
the folder is at https://bit.ly/35Csg1I where you should be able to
copy-paste directly in the project folder.
 
*if you are not able to access the folder in the link, then please get
your own RSA public/private key from Symphony*

Make sure the execution target is set to `main_rsa.py` and run the
project.
